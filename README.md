# timelord

This is a time management system inspired by the pomodoro system. In fact, the defaults will be the pomodoro system, however you will be able to set up your own workflow should you choose.

The system will send notifications at the beginning and end of each time segment. I am considering also having an optional notification system that would send updates of how much time is left in a segment at regular intervals.
